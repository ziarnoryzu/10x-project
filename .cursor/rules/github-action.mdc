## Github Action Rules

Conduct these steps to ensure reliability and high quality of GitHub Actions workflow.

### Version Verification

In Agent Mode:

1. Scan the file that user mentions and look for the public actions used within the workflow. Be explicit.
2. For each action always trigger "Run Terminal" tool to see what is the most up-to-date version with the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"v([0-9]+).*/\1/'
```

3. Make sure you executed this command. Update Github Actions Script only by applying MAJOR version number.

### Installing dependencies

In Agent Mode:

1. Always prefer `npm ci` over `npm install` to ensure sync with lockfile.


### Setup Node

In Agent Mode:

1. Search for `.nvmrc` in project root.
2. If it exists, update CI/CD workflow by applying `node-version-file: '.nvmrc'` to setup-node action.

### Workflow Triggers

In Agent Mode:

1. Ensure proper `default branch` (main or master) by checking current `git` configuration.
