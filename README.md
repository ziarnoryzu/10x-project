## üìù Project Description

Many travelers jot down ideas for their trips in various places, but turning those fragments into a coherent plan is often a time-consuming and challenging task. VibeTravels addresses this by leveraging AI to analyze your notes, understand your preferences, and automatically generate a detailed travel plan. The goal of the MVP is to validate the core idea: users desire an intelligent tool to automate itinerary creation from their own notes.

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Version `22.14.0`. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions.
-   **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ziarnoryzu/10x-project.git VibeTravels
    cd VibeTravels
    ```

2.  **Set the correct Node.js version:**
    If you are using `nvm`, run this command in the project's root directory:
    ```sh
    nvm use
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables. You can get these keys from your Supabase and OpenRouter dashboards.

    ```env
    # Supabase
    SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

    # OpenRouter.ai
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
