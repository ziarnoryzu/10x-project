I'll create a comprehensive migration file based on the db-plan. Let me generate the migration with the current UTC timestamp.

[1 tool called]

Perfect! I've created the migration file `20251017120000_initial_schema.sql` based on your db-plan. Here's what the migration includes:

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Contents

### Tables Created:
1. **`profiles`** - User profile data with name and preferences (JSONB)
2. **`notes`** - Travel notes with title and content
3. **`travel_plans`** - AI-generated travel plans linked to notes

### Key Features:
âœ… **Cascade Delete Relationships** - Deleting a user removes their profile, notes, and associated travel plans  
âœ… **Auto-updating Timestamps** - `updated_at` columns are automatically updated via triggers  
âœ… **Optimized Indexes** - Index on `notes.user_id` for fast user note queries  
âœ… **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Enabled on all tables with granular policies  

### RLS Policies:
- **`profiles`**: Users can SELECT and UPDATE their own profile
- **`notes`**: Users can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE their own notes
- **`travel_plans`**: Users can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE plans for their own notes

### Security Design:
- All policies are granular (one per operation)
- Only `authenticated` role has access (no anonymous access)
- Travel plans access is determined by note ownership via EXISTS subquery

The migration is production-ready with comprehensive comments explaining each section. You can now apply it using:

```bash
supabase db reset
```

or push it to your remote Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase db push
```
