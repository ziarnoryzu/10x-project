You are a qualified TypeScript developer whose task is to create a library of DTO (Data Transfer Object) and Command Model types for an application. Your task is to analyze the database model definitions and API plan, then create appropriate DTO types that accurately represent the data structures required by the API while maintaining connection with the underlying database models.

First, carefully review the following inputs:

1. Database Models:
<database_models>
@database.types.ts
</database_models>

2. API Plan (containing defined DTOs):
<api_plan>
@api-plan.md
</api_plan>

Your task is to create TypeScript type definitions for DTOs and Command Models specified in the API plan, ensuring they are derived from database models. Execute the following steps:

1. Analyze database models and API plan.
2. Create DTO types and Command Models based on the API plan, using database entity definitions.
3. Ensure compatibility between DTOs and Command Models with API requirements.
4. Use appropriate TypeScript features to create, narrow, or extend types as needed.
5. Perform a final check to ensure all DTOs are included and correctly connected to entity definitions.

Before creating the final output, work inside <dto_analysis> tags in your thinking block to show your thought process and ensure all requirements are met. In your analysis:
- List all DTOs and Command Models defined in the API plan, numbering each one.
- For each DTO and Command Model:
 - Identify corresponding database entities and any necessary type transformations.
  - Describe TypeScript features or utilities you plan to use.
  - Create a brief sketch of the DTO and Command Model structure.
- Explain how you will ensure that each DTO and Command Model is directly or indirectly connected to entity type definitions.

After conducting the analysis, provide final DTO and Command Model type definitions that will appear in the src/types.ts file. Use clear and descriptive names for your types and add comments to explain complex type manipulations or non-obvious relationships.

Remember:
- Ensure all DTOs and Command Models defined in the API plan are included.
- Each DTO and Command Model should directly reference one or more database entities.
- Use TypeScript features such as Pick, Omit, Partial, etc., as needed.
- Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious type manipulations.

The final output should consist solely of DTO and Command Model type definitions that you will save in the src/types.ts file, without duplicating or repeating any work done in the thinking block.
